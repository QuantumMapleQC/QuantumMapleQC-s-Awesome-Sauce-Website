    <h2>what is anterminal?</h2>

    <p><strong>anterminal</strong> is a minimal and fast terminal emulator written entirely in <strong>C</strong>, using only Xlib and Makefiles — no external dependencies, no bloat.</p>

    <p>it was built with tiling window managers in mind (like <strong>dwm</strong>, <strong>bspwm</strong>, <strong>sway</strong> etc), making it lightweight, snappy, and perfect for riced desktop setups or suckless-style environments.</p>
    
<p>if you are using Debian based distro, make sure you have these packages installed!</p>
<div class="smaller-terminal-block">
    $ sudo apt install libvte-2.91-dev libconfig-dev
</div>
<p>If you are using Arch linux, Install these packages before anything!</p>
<div class="smaller-terminal-block">
    $ sudo pacman -S vte3 libconfig
</div>

    <div class="terminal-block">
$ git clone https://github.com/antma-window-manager/anterminal
$ cd anterminal
$ make
$ ./anterminal
    </div>

    <p>the goal? just a dead-simple terminal that launches fast, does its job, and fits right into unix-style workflows. no GTK, no QT, no web tech — just raw C and X11. you can theme it, patch it, mod it however you want.</p>

    <p>This project barely gets updated and it does not need to be updated unless we need some patches! Also Anterminal soon will be on AUR</p>
